The official repo for SSearch (SecureSearch)

We are working on a indexer! Better results coming soon with NodeJS package, Vercel API and a NodeJS (Express) API.
This is not the big thing we where working on that is still secret!

We still need allot of websites in our json but when we have allot we will be one of the most secure search engines!

SSearch is a open-source search engine
That can run on almost anything! Because it does not use complex server code,
SSearch is just HTML, CSS, JS and JSON.
And also using https://newsapi.org/ (Version 2) to display news on the homepage.
